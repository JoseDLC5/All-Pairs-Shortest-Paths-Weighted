# All-Pairs-Shortest-Paths-Weighted
Uses Floyd's Algorithm to compute the shortest path between all pairs of nodes in a weighted graph
To be run on the command line using the given makefile.
Usage: ./shortestpaths [filename]

File must be a .txt file that indicates how many nodes are in the graph and all paths in the graph 
Example file in test.txt

Ex:

4 [Number of nodes]
A C 2 [Path from A to C with a weight of 2]
A D 10 [Path from A to D with a weight of 10]
B A 7
B C 5
B D 1
C B 3
D A 2
D B 6
D C 6
